Description: the data on my graphs represents the percentage of freethrow shots versus the ranking of each player. It also displays the average freethrow shots from each NBA team in the year 2023. I selected this data set to see how closely the percentage followed up to each player depending on their rankings. There were no major gaps as the rankings go down the percentage only drops a little each time. I also wanted to know which teams had the highest freethrow percentage.
